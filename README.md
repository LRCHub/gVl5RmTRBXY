# tripleS – Girls Never Die

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
I set a phase
For me to fall headfirst
Into some things
That never will work

This time
I felt low
I followed and fell
This time
I felt low
I followed and fell

Young girls never die
We just rot inside
Young girls never die
We just rot inside
Young girls never die
We just rot inside
Young girls never die
We just rot inside

The future's in my hands he says
but why do i feel powerless
When i grow you victim the old
Who tells me all i need to know?

These times
They feel low
I'm unseen, i'm followed
These times
They feel low
I'm unseen, i'm followed

I don't feel enough
When i look in your eyes
I followed and fell
From your hollow insides

Young girls never die
We just rot inside
Young girls never die
We just rot inside
Young girls never die
We just rot inside
Young girls never die
We just rot inside
Young girls never die
We just rot inside
Young girls never die
We just rot inside
Young girls never die
We just rot inside
Young girls never die
We just rot inside
